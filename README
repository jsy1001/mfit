       mfit: Model Fitting Software for Optical Interferometry

                       package release 1.5.2


                           Release notes
			   
LICENSING

This software is released into the public domain, in the hope that it
will be useful. There is of course no warranty of any sort.


DESCRIPTION

mfit is a tool for fitting simple parametrisations of the sky
brightness distribution to optical (visible/IR) interferometry data.

Features of mfit include:

* Asymmetric, multi-component models 
* Four limb-darkening parametrizations (Taylor and Gauss-Hermite
  expansions, Hestroffer and square-root models), plus support for arbitrary
  limb-darkening profiles specified numerically (may be wavelength-dependent)
* Support for wavelength-dependent models  (specified model parameters
  can take different values for different wavebands)
* Interactive, command-line, and GUI interfaces 
* Plots of data and model
* Optional marginalisation by numerical integration of the
  posterior probability (requires commercial NAG library)

The graphical interface, fitgui, can straightforwardly be integrated
into other applications written in python.

Please refer to the NEWS file for details of user-visible changes in this
release.


REQUIREMENTS

mfit should work on any unix-like operating system (see below for those it has
been tested on). You will need a Fortran 90 or 95 compiler to build mfit.

mfit must be linked with the following libraries (not supplied, but free
software):

* PGPLOT - http://www.astro.caltech.edu/~tjp/pgplot/

* CFITSIO - http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/fitsio/fitsio.html

* FFTW (v3) - http://www.fftw.org/

If you have it, mfit can make use of the commercial Numerical Algorithms Group
Fortran Library (Mark 19 recommended) - see
http://www.nag.co.uk/numeric/fl/FLdescription.asp

If the NAG library is not available, the marginalisation-by-integration
features of mfit ('--margerr', '--plot mpost', '--plot mpost2d' in clfit) will
not work.

To build mfit, you will need scons - see http://www.scons.org - and a working
installation of Python (1.5.2 or later).

To run the fitgui graphical interface, you will need a working
installation of Python 2.2 or above and Tkinter (see
http://www.python.org).

BUILDING MFIT

scons is now used to build mfit. If the 'scons' command is not available on
your system, retrieve scons from http://www.scons.org and install it.

If your combination of operating system and Fortran 90/95 compiler is not one
of those listed below, you *may* need to edit the section labelled
'#### May need to edit this section ####' at the top of the SConstruct file.

Note that the SConstruct file is a Python script. Please contact the author if
the distributed SConstruct file does not work for you and you are not sure how
to edit it.

Build mfit by typing 'scons' at the shell prompt (from the directory containing
the source code). The following command-line options are supported:
'debug=1': compile with debugging flags (-g etc.) - this is the default
'debug=0': compile without debugging flags
'release=0': compile without optimization flags - this is the default
'release=1': compile with  optimization flags (-O etc.)
'f95=/path/to/f95': use specified compiler, rather than auto-detected one


mfit has been tested using:
- Sun Workshop Fortran 95 on Solaris
- NAGWare Fortran 95 on Solaris
- NAGWare Fortran 95 on Linux
- G95 on Linux
- GFortran 4.6 & 4.3 on Linux (will not work with GFortran versions < 4.3)
- G95 on MacOS X (thanks to Ettore Pedretti)

Please report successes or failures with other compilers/operating systems.


INSTALLING MFIT

Build the executables as described above.

Edit the command following '#!' at the top of 'fitgui' so that it
starts the Python interpreter on your system. Put the 'mfit' and
'clfit' executables and the 'fitgui' script somewhere in the PATH. Put
'fitgui.py' somewhere in your python module search path (e.g. in one
of the directories in $PYTHONPATH).

[If you are a COASTie, the following commands should accomplish the
 above for our complicated install scheme (make sure you have checked
 the 'build' package out of CVS; refer to the Data Reduction Manual,
 'Maintaining the Software' and
 http://oberon.ra.phy.cam.ac.uk/coast/local_web/rsync.html):

 > gmake -f makefile.coast install
 > epkg -s DEPOT-DIR/mfit mfit

 where DEPOT-DIR is /coast/depot-sparc if installing on the Sun cluster, or
 /coast/depot-i386 for Linux.

USING MFIT

Please refer to the instructions in the 'documentation' file.


BUGS

Please report the inevitable bugs to jsy1001 (at) cam.ac.uk. Various
missing features are listed in 'documentation'.
