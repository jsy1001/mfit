LICENSING

This software is released into the public domain, in the hope that it
will be useful. There is of course no warranty of any sort.


DESCRIPTION

mfit is a tool for fitting simple parametrisations of the sky
brightness distribution to optical (visible/IR) interferometry data.

Features of mfit include:

* Asymmetric, multi-component models 
* Four limb-darkening parametrizations (Taylor and Gauss-Hermite
  expansions, Hestroffer and square-root models), plus support for arbitrary
  limb-darkening profiles specified numerically (may be wavelength-dependent)
* Interactive, command-line, and GUI interfaces 
* Plots of data and model

The graphical interface, fitgui, can straightforwardly be integrated
into other applications written in python.


REQUIREMENTS

You will need a Fortran 90 compiler to build mfit.

mfit must be linked with the following libraries (not supplied, but free
software):

* PGPLOT - http://www.astro.caltech.edu/~tjp/pgplot/

* FITSIO - http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/fitsio/fitsio.html

* Starlink PDA - http://star-www.rl.ac.uk/cgi-store/storeform1?PDA

* FFTW (v2) - http://www.fftw.org/

To run the fitgui graphical interface, you will need a working
installation of Python 2.2 or above and Tkinter (see
http://www.python.org).

BUILDING MFIT

Use the supplied 'makefile' (makefile.coast is probably not
useful). Edit the lines above the comment
'# *** Modify above this line for your system ***'.

Various example configurations are included; comment out the most
appropriate one as a starting point. If any of the external libraries
PGPLOT, FITSIO, or PDA were compiled with a Fortran 77 compiler
(likely, unless you compile them yourself) you will have to add the
Fortran 77 standard libraries to FFLAGL.

mfit has been tested using Sun Workshop Fortran 95 and NAGWare Fortran
95 on Solaris, but should work on any other Unix-like system with a
Fortran 90 compiler. Please report successes or failures with other
compilers/operating systems.


INSTALLING MFIT

Build the executables as described above.

Edit the command following '#!' at the top of 'fitgui' so that it
starts the Python interpreter on your system. Put the 'mfit' and
'clfit' executables and the 'fitgui' script somewhere in the PATH. Put
'fitgui.py' somewhere in your python module search path (e.g. in one
of the directories in $PYTHONPATH).

[If you are a COASTie, the following commands should accomplish the
 above for our complicated install scheme (make sure you have checked
 the 'build' package out of CVS; refer to the Data Reduction Manual,
 'Maintaining the Software' and
 http://oberon.ra.phy.cam.ac.uk/coast/local_web/rsync.html):

 > gmake -f makefile.coast install
 > epkg -s DEPOT-DIR/mfit mfit

 where DEPOT-DIR is /coast/depot-sparc if installing on the Sun cluster, or
 /coast/depot-i386 for Linux.
]


USING MFIT

Please refer to the instructions in the 'documentation' file.


BUGS

Please report the inevitable bugs to jsy1001 (at) cam.ac.uk. Various
missing features are listed in 'documentation'.
