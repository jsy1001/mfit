New in mfit release 1.5.3
=========================

* Plotted uv points are saved to text files (this feature was
  previously added for other plot types)


New in mfit release 1.5.2
=========================

* No longer depends on Starlink SLALIB and PDA libraries; the required
  source code from these libraries is distributed with mfit.


New in mfit release 1.5.1
=========================

* Minimiser now works with scaled model parameters, hence performs
  better. Parameter scaling factors are varied iteratively to find the
  best minimum

* Now built using scons (more portable) rather than make

* Use of NAG library optional (detected by scons)

* Support for brute-force marginalisation - integrates posterior
  probability in multiple dimensions (slow, requires NAG library)

* Support for wavelength-dependent models (specified model parameters
  can take different values for different wavebands)

* Support for rotating model components (i.e. polar angle theta varies
  linearly with time)

* '#relto' option for model component positions - specifies position
  of model component w.r.t. position of another component

* Comments now allowed anywhere in model file

* Added plots versus Modified Julian Day, GMST and baseline position angle

* Plotted points are also saved to text files, for re-plotting in
  other applications

* Added 'mplot' application to plot intensity distribution of model


New in mfit release 1.4.1
=========================

* Replaced Numerical Recipes routines with free equivalents; mfit can
  now be distributed to the community

* Added support for *wavelength-dependent* numerical centre-to-limb
  intensity profiles

* User can specify a range of wavelengths to use from the data

* Added plots of squared visibility and triple amplitude and phase
  versus wavelength

* User can specify a TARGET_ID to use from OIFITS data

* User can specify calibration error (extra fractional error in mod V)
  to add to OIFITS data. This feature was previously restricted to
  other formats


New in mfit release 1.3.1 (released to COAST team on 2003/09/11)
=========================

* Added support for numerical centre-to-limb intensity profiles e.g.
Kurucz models

* Takes into account bandwidth smearing (assuming a tophat bandpass)

* Option to plot 1-d cut through posterior

This version *may not* be released to the public, as
non-freely-distributable code from Numerical Recipes is used (other
routines could be substituted if this were deemed to be worth the effort).
The public website for mfit - http://www.mrao.cam.ac.uk/~jsy1001/mfit/ -
describes the previous 1.2.1 release.
