New in mfit release 1.4.1
=========================

* Replaced Numerical Recipes routines with free equivalents; mfit can
  now be distributed to the community

* Added support for *wavelength-dependent* numerical centre-to-limb
  intensity profiles

* User can specify a range of wavelengths to use from the data

* Added plots of squared visibility and triple amplitude and phase
  versus wavelength

* User can specify a TARGET_ID to use from OIFITS data


New in mfit release 1.3.1 (released to COAST team on 2003/09/11)
=========================

* Added support for numerical centre-to-limb intensity profiles e.g.
Kurucz models

* Takes into account bandwidth smearing (assuming a tophat bandpass)

* Option to plot 1-d cut through posterior

This version *may not* be released to the public, as
non-freely-distributable code from Numerical Recipes is used (other
routines could be substituted if this were deemed to be worth the effort).
The public website for mfit - http://www.mrao.cam.ac.uk/~jsy1001/mfit/ -
describes the previous 1.2.1 release.
